How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    Tedious. Annoying.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Bugs and changes.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Forget commiting, logical commit vs to large version history, many unlogical commit

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Development environment vs user environment

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log shows a log of changes, starting with newest change. git diff compares
    two files for changes.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?
